# orb-ui Roadmap

This roadmap is public planning, not a promise of dates or exact release contents. It should help contributors understand where the project is headed without exposing private analytics, credentials, or internal notes.

## Near Term

### Signal-based adapter API — complete

The adapter signal model now reports state, input volume, output volume, and errors as one coherent update.

Target direction:

- Add an `OrbSignal` type
- Add a `signal` prop for controlled usage
- Support `inputVolume` and `outputVolume`
- Add a `thinking` voice state
- Document migration from callback-object adapters — complete
- Remove callback-object adapter compatibility in 0.5.0 — complete
- Remove surprising global audio behavior from `Orb`

### Directional signal calibration — complete in 0.8.0

Every built-in adapter now targets a stable normalized speech envelope with the same semantic
distribution: silence at `0`, ordinary speech around `0.5`, and strong uncommon peaks near `1`.
Input and output use separate provider profiles because microphone and playback measurements have
different raw distributions.

Completed direction:

- Replace provider-specific gain, curve, attack, and release constants with named amplitude anchors
  and elapsed-time envelope semantics
- Ship directional defaults for every available provider signal
- Validate Vapi, ElevenLabs, LiveKit, Pipecat, OpenAI Realtime, and Gemini with live input/output recordings and controlled speech
  through browser microphone processing; retune the profiles that overstate ordinary speech
- Meter Vapi microphone input from its SDK-owned track and tune continuous assistant output levels
  against live recordings
- Keep Pipecat playback reactive when overlapping LLM/TTS generation events arrive during speech
- Keep Gemini listening during user interruption when buffered output chunks are still arriving
- Use OpenAI WebRTC playback boundaries to prevent state flicker before audio arrives and after
  playback ends; calibrate assistant output against independent live speech measurements
- Keep available input and output envelopes warm across active conversation states so provider
  mode events never inject an artificial zero
- Add raw, mapped, and normalized diagnostics to all adapter volume callbacks
- Generate profiles from guided silence, quiet, normal, and energetic captures in the provider
  playground instead of relying on manual sliders
- Remove the ambiguous `volume` prop and `OrbSignal.volume` in favor of `inputVolume` and
  `outputVolume`

Live provider validation and visual review are complete across all six providers and the four
built-in themes. Calibration and theme customization ship together in 0.8.0. Physical microphone
and room-acoustic coverage remains outside the controlled digital microphone checks.

### LiveKit adapter — complete

First-class LiveKit Agents support includes signal-native state, local microphone and remote agent
volume metering, attached agent audio, and token-source based connection setup. The adapter should
keep browser auth explicit by favoring token endpoints and LiveKit sandbox token servers over raw
pasted participant tokens. The dedicated browser entrypoint owns the standard LiveKit SDK runtime,
token source, and room naming so the normal setup only needs a token endpoint and optional agent
name; advanced app-owned Room modes remain available separately. Speech-oriented analyser ranges
and output calibration hooks keep the normalized signal dynamic across normal agent voices.

### Pipecat adapter — complete

The transport-agnostic Pipecat adapter consumes `PipecatClient` RTVI events and supports Pipecat
Cloud/Daily, self-hosted SmallWebRTC, and custom client transports. It normalizes state and both
audio levels while leaving agent deployment and connection credentials in the application. Direct
browser-track metering fills gaps when a transport does not emit frequent RTVI audio-level events.

### OpenAI Realtime adapter — complete

The OpenAI Realtime adapter owns browser WebRTC, audio playback, input/output metering, and current
GA session events. Server-side client-secret creation stays explicit in user apps.

### Gemini Live adapter — complete

The Gemini Live adapter owns browser microphone PCM streaming, native-audio playback, interruption
handling, and signal normalization. Applications still own the official GenAI client and ephemeral
token creation.

### SEO and documentation foundations — complete

Canonical documentation routes now own provider, example, and implementation-guide content. The
site uses one sitemap index for the homepage and documentation sitemap, redirects legacy static
HTML routes to their maintained equivalents, and links directly from the homepage to provider and
use-case guides. Documentation pages use one descriptive page heading and implementation-focused
content that stays aligned with the public API.

Voice-orb discovery now builds on those routes: the homepage introduces the React voice orb while
retaining its broader voice agent UI positioning, the ElevenLabs guide explains visual choices
and includes a complete integration, and both provider and animation guides embed an interactive
theme/state preview. The animation example remains a secondary homepage documentation link.

## Experience

### More impressive themes

Add polished themes that feel production-ready, not just minimal examples. Public API names should stay neutral and ownable.

Completed direction:

- `radial`: four-lobe aqua and cobalt field with a volume-reactive outer membrane for human input,
  independent angular deformation for agent output, and a dedicated phone control
- `cloud`: atmospheric blue-violet sphere with a solid-dot-to-fluid connection entrance,
  state-paced internal cloud motion, opposing input/output volume response, and passive
  external-control support

Before naming another public theme, validate the visual direction against direct product UI research
and a concrete interaction reference.

### Better demo — complete

The homepage now presents orb-ui as a complete product surface instead of a loose collection of
controls:

- Live simulated and manual session modes
- Theme, state, and audio-level controls
- Provider-specific integration examples with copyable code
- Clear provider and controlled-mode paths
- An editorial documentation directory for deeper implementation guidance

### Theme response and customization — complete

The theme configuration API lets applications choose an intentional preset or override a theme's
appearance, geometry, and motion without changing provider measurement semantics. A string theme
name remains shorthand for its balanced preset.

Completed direction:

- Add `balanced`, `calm`, and `expressive` presets while keeping today's behavior as `balanced`
- Add theme-specific appearance, geometry, and motion overrides with semantic parameter names
- Keep visual response timing and easing separate from provider rise/fall normalization
- Add responsive design tokens, stable semantic slots, and application-wide theme defaults
- Allow custom renderers and replaceable control chrome without giving up Orb signal/lifecycle logic
- Add preset selection to the provider playground for comparing every provider, theme, and speaking
  direction against the same normalized signal
- Keep provider-specific measurement details out of theme implementations
- Preserve Cloud session animation through live preset, appearance, and responsive size changes,
  with browser regression coverage for frame continuity

## Ongoing

- Keep docs search-friendly and implementation-honest
- Keep adapter code dependency-light
- Keep animations accessible, performant, and responsive
- Prefer small provider-specific adapters over one opaque universal client
